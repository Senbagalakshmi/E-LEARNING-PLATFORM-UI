# Project Description: E-learning Platform UI
This project is a front-end user interface for an E-learning Platform, developed as part of CODTECH Internship Task-4. The goal of the project is to create a fully interactive and styled multi-page application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, without any backend technologies.

The platform provides essential e-learning features including user registration, login, a personalized dashboard, course listing, course search, course video playback, progress tracking, and the ability to add new courses dynamically. It also includes a dark mode toggle for better user experience.

#  Features Overview
    1. User Authentication
         Registration Page: Allows new users to sign up with a username and password.

         Login Page: Authenticates existing users using data stored in localStorage.

    2. Dashboard
         Displays a list of available courses with title and description.

         Users can add new courses by filling out a form (Title, Description, Video File Name).

         The newly added courses are stored in the browser's localStorage and persist even after refreshing.

    3. Search Functionality
          A real-time search bar filters displayed courses based on keywords entered by the user.

    4. Course Video Playback
          Clicking on a course opens a video player page.

          The video is embedded and plays directly in the browser.

          Playback progress is tracked and saved locally.

    5. Progress Tracking
          As users watch videos, their watch progress is saved.

This helps users keep track of completed and pending lessons.

‚úÖ 6. Dark Mode Toggle
A button allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

The preference is saved in localStorage to maintain the theme across sessions.

# üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For building the structure of all web pages.

CSS3: For responsive and attractive styling, including layout, fonts, colors, and themes.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For all dynamic interactions, event handling, data storage, and UI updates.

LocalStorage: To simulate user data, course storage, login sessions, progress tracking, and dark mode preferences.

# üìÑ Pages Created
Page	Purpose
index.html	Welcome/Landing page
register.html	New user registration
login.html	Existing user login
dashboard.html	Course list, search, and course addition
video.html	Course video playback with progress tracking

# üéØ Objective
To simulate a real-world e-learning experience using only front-end technologies, enabling you to:

Practice front-end development

Use local storage to mimic backend functionality

Understand UI/UX workflows

Build fully interactive multi-page apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

# üèÅ Conclusion
This E-learning Platform UI fulfills the internship task requirements by offering a clean, dynamic, and interactive interface. It demonstrates your understanding of front-end technologies, client-side logic, and browser storage, making it a strong addition to your developer portfolio.
